# Braid-util

See [braid](https://github.com/RobBlackwell/braid).

Borrows heavily from

thanks - see copyright notices.

THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL CODE THAT IS
SUBJECT TO CHANGE. I welcome feedback, but it's probably too early to
consider including in Quicklisp yet. That doesnt stop you trying it
with quicklisp by using
[local-projects](http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/faq.html).
